      <h2>What is animal testing?</h2>
      <p>
        The term “animal testing” refers to procedures performed on living
        animals for purposes of research into basic biology and diseases,
        assessing the effectiveness of new medicinal products, and testing the
        human health and/or environmental safety of consumer and industry
        products such as cosmetics, household cleaners, food additives,
        pharmaceuticals and industrial/agro chemicals.
        <br />
        All procedures, even those classified as “mild,” have the potential to
        cause the animals physical as well as psychological distress and
        suffering. Most animals are killed at the end of an experiment, but some
        may be re-used in subsequent experiments. (Humane Society International)
